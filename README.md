# Name-Capitalization-Method
Method that correctly capitalizes names.  Accounts for prefixes &amp; suffixes, apostrophes, and other scenarios where using something like `UCWORDS(STRTOLOWER($STR))` doesn't work.  Credit for this method goes to Armand Niculescu: https://www.media-division.com/correct-name-capitalization-in-php/.  There wasn't a Github repo anywhere, so I placed it here.
